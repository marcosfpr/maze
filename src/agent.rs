//! AI Agent
//!
//! AI is about practical reasoning: reasoning in order to do something.
//! A coupling of perception, reasoning, and acting comprises an agent.
//! An agent acts in an environment. An agentâ€™s environment often includes other
//! agents. An agent together with its environment is called a world.
//!
//! An agent could be, for example, a coupling of a computational engine with
//! physical sensors and actuators,  called a robot, where the environment is a
//! physical setting. An autonomous agent is one that acts in the  world without
//! human intervention. A semi-autonomous agent acts with a human-in-the-loop
//! who may provide  perceptual information and carry out the task. An agent
//! could be a program that acts in a purely computational  environment, a
//! software agent, often called a bot.

/// - prior knowledge about  the environment
/// - stimuli received from the environment, which can include observations
///   about the environment
///  (e.g., light, sound, keyboard commands, web requests) as well as actions
/// that the environment  imposes on the agent (e.g., bumping the agent)
/// - past experiences, including history of interaction with the environment
///   (its previous actions and stimuli)
/// and other data, from which it can learn
/// - goals that it must try to achieve or preferences over states of the world
/// - abilities, the primitive actions the agent is capable of carrying out.
